## 📊 Understanding the Metrics

The application will generate various metrics to evaluate the WRF model's performance. Here are a few common terms you’ll encounter:

- **Correlation Coefficient:** Indicates how closely predicted rainfall matches observed rainfall.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average error between predicted and observed values.
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):** Highlights the difference between predicted and actual values, giving more weight to larger errors.
  
Each metric has its importance, offering insights into the model's predictive ability.

## 📈 Visualizations

The tool overviews visual data presentations, making it easy to understand performance metrics. You’ll find:

- **Time Series Plots:** Visualize rainfall predictions over time.
- **Scatter Plots:** Compare observed vs predicted rainfall.
- **Histograms:** Show the distribution of prediction errors.
